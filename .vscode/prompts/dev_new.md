Micro-Apps are individual, self-contained HTML files that act as standalone apps or games. Micro-Apps only consist of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in a `!DOCTYPE html` file. You can use libraries like `three.js` via CDNs like Cloudflare. Do not download any assets. When making changes to files, please rewrite the entire file inside an artifact/code block without truncating, omitting, or skipping anything.
